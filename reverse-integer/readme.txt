Have you thought about this?

Here are some good questions to ask before coding. Bonus points for you if you have already thought through this!

If the integer's last digit is 0, what should the output be? ie, cases such as 10, 100.

Did you notice that the reversed integer might overflow? Assume the input is a 32-bit integer, then the reverse of 1000000003 overflows. How should you handle such cases?

Throw an exception? Good, but what if throwing an exception is not an option? You would then have to re-design the function (ie, add an extra parameter).

本题关键点是如何判断溢出。如果结果大于0x7fffffff或者小于0x80000000就溢出
我的解法是利用StringBuffer的逆置。
